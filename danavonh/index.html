      <article>Here's some IRONIC text: Sometimes you need to see how a website design or page layout will look with text in place before you can decide whether or not it's going to work for you. But how, you ask, can we do that when the content hasn't been written yet? Lorem ipsum, my friend. It's traditionally Latin gibberish, but can be far more fun thanks to the list of awesome dummy text generators we found.</article>
